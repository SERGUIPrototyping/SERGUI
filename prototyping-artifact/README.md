# Prototyping Artifact Example

In this section, we provide a detailed overview and example of the GUI prototyping artifact that will be generated after the automatic interaction of the customer or user with the *SERGUI* approach. The generated file is composed as a PDF and a concrete example is attached in this directory. The example shows a shopping app consisting of overall six GUIs, each with additional requirements that are captured on other GUIs. In the following, we provide further explanation of the structure of the created GUI prototyping artifact.

## A) App Requirements Summary

First, the overall application and journey through the main part of the application is shown in a linear wireframe. In the following, we show an excerpt of the app requirements summary of the provided example. 

## B) GUI Summary

Second, the summaries for individual GUIs are provided after the app requirements summary. Here, for each GUI included in the app requirements summary, potentially multiple additional pages are generated providing more detailed information about the GUI, the natural language requirement or description of the GUI, a collection of additional requirements (in the form of *aspect*-GUI visualizations) not captured by the main GUI selected by the user as the main representation for that type of GUI and additional natural language requirements, if the features were relevant to the user but no matching *aspect*-GUI visualizing of the GUI feature could be found.
