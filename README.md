The supplementary material of our submission to the RE 2024 conference is structured as follows:

- **few-shot-prompting**: This directory contains a few-shot prompting example and a more detailed explanation of the employed prompting template for GUI feature prediction
- **gui2r**: This directory contains the overall Python-based implementation of the GUI ranking models, GUI feature ranking and GUI feature recommendation approaches
- **notebooks**: This directory contains the Jupyter Notebooks for *(1)* computing the evaluation results for *SERGUI* and *(2)* the CNN-based GUI filtering method
- **prototyping-artifact**: This directory contains an example and explanation of the GUI prototyping artifact generated by the *SERGUI* approach
- **rasa**: This directory contains all code and resources used to implement the dialogue system (based on RASA) inlcluding the Python-based actions, employed data (NLU, Rules and Stories), the dialogue system configuration, credentials, domain file and endpoint configuration
- **user_study**: This directory contains all the datasets used for the evaluation of *SERGUI* on the basis of the conducted user study
- **webapp**: This directoy contains the prototypical implementation of our *SERGUI* approach based on a Django web application
